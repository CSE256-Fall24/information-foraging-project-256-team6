Classrooms Changes:
- Repetitive sidebar taken out
- images moved to right side of each classroom
- Teddy Bears (AM), class times specified in parenthesis, clicking on it will also take you to that specific classes page

- Teddy Bears changes I started: teachers will be displayed in right sidebar rather than the old sidebar

- Removing past parent reviews from panda bear classroom page
- Recreated the reviews slideshow in the apply tab
- On homepage added link to classroom overview with icon to help it stand out
- Minor adjustments to teddy bear page: a more details-based paragraph moved down the page, font sizes adjusted on certain elements, teachers aside css adjustments- top: 100px added so teacher header is visible, css for the whole aside to be scrollable added in teddy_bears.css but commented it out since it isn't working exactly as intended
- Goal of above minor changes: make Teddy Bear page the "model" page that once we all agree is designed well we can replicate on all other classroom pages
- Announcements column on homepage made scrollable with a max height
