        <h1>Philosophy</h1>
        <h2>
          Washington University Nursery School teachers are attentive to
          individual needs, serving as catalysts to spark each child’s interests
          and desire to experiment and explore. Our school provides a safe,
          nurturing environment that encourages growth and independence in all
          developmental areas.

          The philosophy of the nursery school is that children learn most
          effectively through play. Our approach is “hands-on,” where children
          act upon what they are learning and feeling. We consider the process
          more important than the product. Teachers provide the opportunity for
          children to interact with their environment in ways that are
          meaningful to them. For each class, teachers develop a curriculum that
          reflects the interests and abilities of the children in the classroom.
          In addition, all children actively participate with specialists in
          science, art, music and Spanish. As trends in the field of early
          education change, we evaluate what is new and determine if it would be
          enriching for our program.
        </p>
        <p>
          The staff at the nursery school respects and appreciates the talents
          and personalities of each child and his or her family. A teacher’s
          individual talents are also encouraged as she or he develops his or
          her own personal approach in the classroom. This makes for a vibrant,
          growing community of children, families and teachers.

        <!-- <h1>Discipline</h1>
        <p>The	staff	and	director	at	WUNS	work	to	maintain	a	very	positive	and	nurturing	environment
          for	each	child.		Classroom	limits	are	necessary	to	provide	a	sense	of	order	and	allow	teachers
          to	spend	as	much	time	as	possible	providing	a	stimulating	environment	for	each	child.		Our
          rule	of	thumb	is	that	children	keep	themselves	safe,	keep	friends	safe,	and	the	toys	at	school
          safe.
        </p>
        <p>
          The	staff	is	trained	to	anticipate	potentially	problematic	situations;	they	remind	children	of
          appropriate	behavior	and	redirect	or	intervene	when	necessary.		In	most	cases,	teachers	can
          stop	or	re-direct	behavior	before	something	negative	occurs.		If	not,	teachers	will	first	consult
          the	injured	party	to	make	sure	they	are	emotionally	and	physically	okay.		Then,	they	will	turn
          their	attention	to	the	child	who	might	need	more	support	in	“keeping	their	friends	safe”	or,
          more	likely,	“keeping	their	bodies	safe”	with	others.		Reflection	over	what	has	occurred	will
          lead	to	discovering	other	behavior	options	and	resolving	things	with	the	peer
        </p>
        <p>
          Encouragement	and	pride	in	self	is	the	basis	of	our	discipline	policy.	Our	aim	is	to	have	the
          children	manage	their	own	actions	and	reactions.	The	teachers	and	staff	will	help	children
          learn	and	develop	skills	that	they	need	to	display	appropriate	behavior.			This	is	done
          through:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Positive	reinforcement.</li>
          <li>Anticipating	unhealthy	social	interaction.</li>
          <li>Re-direction:		guiding	a	child	toward	appropriate,	socially	positive	activities.</li>
          <li>Naming	and	validating	child&apos;s	feelings</li>
          <li>Expressing	disappointment	or	disapproval	in a	respectful	and	constructive	manner.</li>
          <li>Simple,	logical	and	immediate	consequences.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When	inappropriate	behavior	is	a	continuing	problem, the	school	will	work	with	parents	to
          understand	the	issue	and	make	appropriate	recommendations.		It	is	our	goal	to	make	school
          a	positive,	rewarding	and	enjoyable	experience	for	each	child.		We	realize, however,	that	we
          cannot	meet	the	needs	of	all	children	and	parents.		If	it	is	determined	that	a	child	is	not
          growing	from	his/her	preschool	experience	at	the	Nursery	School, a	discussion	will	be	held
          with	parents	at	which	it	may	be	decided	that	this	program	is	not	appropriate	for	the	child.
          The	director	and	teachers	will	make	recommendations	of	other	preschool	programs	and
          relevant	community	services	if	parents	so	desire.
