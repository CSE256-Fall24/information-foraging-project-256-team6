            We’ve seen definite growth in our child’s social-emotional
            skills, and we appreciate that the teachers encourage
            independence and resolution of conflict between the children
            to allow them to get comfortable using these skills.

            (WUNS) is a safe and wonderful place that fosters growth in a
            play-based (as it should be!) program.

            The program has brought a structure and discipline and
            prepared my (child) well for kindergarten this year. I was
            amazed how the teachers cleverly integrated a variety of
            science/math/art/craft concepts into the curriculum so well.

            The indoor and outdoor play areas are very nice, but what
            makes the school so special are the teachers and the caring,
            cooperative, loving atmosphere they foster among the students
            and throughout the classroom activities.

            I particularly like the walks the class takes around campus.
            Those stick with (my child) and provide a wonderful learning
            opportunity and change of scenery.

            She felt completely comfortable with other children and gained
            confidence for herself. I believe that she knows how much she
            is loved by teachers and children.

            My child almost always gets back in the car happy (and often
            times worn out!) about her full morning. She adores her
            teachers and has made friends. I like that there is a free
            choice environment while still maintaining routine/structure.
            She also seems to particularly enjoy art class!

            The school is tidy and the kids seem to feel ownership over
            taking care of their space. The outdoor amenities are safe and
            messy and fun and just right for Pre-K.
