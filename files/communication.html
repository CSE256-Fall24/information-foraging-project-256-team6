      <h1>Communication</h1>
      <h3><strong>Parent-Staff Communication</strong></h3>
      <p>
        Communication is ongoing throughout the year. Newsletters, the school website and emails
        give you information on current themes, activities and upcoming events. Phone calls and/or
        emails by classroom teachers to discuss your child's adjustment, observations and/or
        concerns are common. If you feel you need to speak to a teacher or the director, please email
        or call the office. Teachers can be reached by phone or email after the school day is over.
      </p>
      <p>
        Learning and curricular themes, specialist schedules, and activities will be posted weekly on the WUNS classroom
        website.
        This is a great way to talk with your child about his/her day or week.
        You may find if you ask your child, “What did you do today?”, you might hear, “Nothing”.
        If you know about specific activities that occurred, you can ask more direct questions: “Can you tell me about
        the picture you painted today?”
        Because the curriculum is planned, some changes based on spontaneous learning opportunities, children’s
        interests, and needs can be expected.
        We encourage you to provide WUNS with an e-mail address.
        This can facilitate timely communication and notification of special classroom and WUNS events.
        The teachers will also use email to send newsletters and weekly project work descriptions to you.
      </p>
      <h1>Assessments</h1>
      <h3><strong>General Assessment</strong></h3>
      <p>
        Assessment is an ongoing process at WUNS. Teachers interact with children in their play,
        conversations and observations both in the classrooms and during outdoor play. Teachers
        keep notes on each child, writing about strengths and weaknesses in all areas of their
        development. Assessment includes checklists, timelines and examples of the children’s
        writings and pictures. Teaching teams meet weekly to discuss each child and plan activities
        in their program to enhance needed skills for children.
        <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <h3><strong>Parent-Teacher Conferences</strong></h3>
      <p>
        The school has two Parent Conferences during the school year. The fall conference is an
        informal, getting-to-know-the-child-and-family discussion. The spring conference includes a
        more detailed, written assessment. A parent-teacher conference can be scheduled at any
        time during the year as needed and by request of parents and/or teachers.
